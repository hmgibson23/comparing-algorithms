====================

Course material for comparing algorithms class


### Lesson 1 - Search and simple Recursion

An introduction is how to figure out the complexity of a couple of
search algorithms and some well-known recursive monsters.

### Lesson 2 - Data Structures

Differences between linked lists, binary trees, heaps and arrays.

### Lesson 3 - Sorting

Because it wouldn't be a course on algorithms without showing off some
famous sorting algorithms.

### Lesson 4 - Advanced (sort of) techniques

Randomised algorithms and data structures and dynamic programming.

When should you use a Skip List over a normal linked list? How does
randomisation help optimisation? WTF is dynamic programming and how
can it help you?
