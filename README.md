Comparing Algorithms
====================

course material for comparing algorithms class


### lesson 1 - search and simple recursion

an introduction is how to figure out the complexity of a couple of
search algorithms and some well-known recursive monsters.

### lesson 2 - data structures

differences between linked lists, binary trees, heaps and arrays.

### lesson 3 - sorting

because it wouldn't be a course on algorithms without showing off some
famous sorting algorithms.

### lesson 4 - advanced (sort of) techniques

randomised algorithms and data structures, dynamic programming.

when should you use a skip list over a balanced binary tree? How does
randomisation help optimisation? WTF is dynamic programming and how
can it help you?
